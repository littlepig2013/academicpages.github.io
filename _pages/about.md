I'm Zichen Zhu(朱子晨 in Chinese). I am currently a 2nd-year MPhil candidate in Database Group, department of Computer Science in the University of Hong Kong, advised by [Prof. Reynold Cheng](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~ckcheng/). Before that,
I got my bachelor degree in software engineering of Tsinghua University.

My research interests focus on data mining in heterogeneous information network, distributed graph computing, and database.

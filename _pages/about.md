I am a 2nd-year MPhil student in Database Group, department of Computer Science at The University of Hong Kong where I work with [Prof. Reynold Cheng](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~ckcheng/).

Recently I'm an intern as a research assistant in [DASLab](http://daslab.seas.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) , working on the optimizing the key-value store.

My research interests focus on data mining in heterogeneous information network, distributed graph computing, and database.

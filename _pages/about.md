I am a 2nd-year MPhil candidate in Database Group, department of Computer Science at The University of Hong Kong where I work with [Prof. Reynold Cheng](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~ckcheng/).

My research interests focus on data mining in heterogeneous information network, distributed graph computing, and database.
